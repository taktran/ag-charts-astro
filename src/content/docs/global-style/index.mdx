title: "Global Styling"
---

Global Style refers to the overall design of the grid, which is controlled using CSS.

The grid's Global Style is highly customisable:

- The first step is to select a [theme](/themes/) from one of our provided themes.

- Next you can [apply customisations](/global-style-customisation/) to the theme using CSS variables and rules.

- If you are using Sass, check out the [Sass API](/global-style-customisation-sass/) which provides additional validation.

Alternatively if you want to change the appearance of individual columns, headers or cells then consider using [row styles](/row-styles/), [cell styles](/cell-styles/) or [custom renderers](/component-types/).
