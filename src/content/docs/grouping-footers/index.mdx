This section shows how to add group footers to show group level totals.

## Enabling Group Footers

If you want to include a footer with each group, set the property `groupIncludeFooter` to true. It is also possible to 
include a 'grand' total footer for all groups using the property `groupIncludeTotalFooter`.

```
const gridOptions = {
    // adds subtotals
    groupIncludeFooter: true,
    // includes grand total
    groupIncludeTotalFooter: true,
}
```

Note that these properties can be used together to produce totals across all group levels.

The following example demonstrates these properties. Note the following:

- Expanding groups reveals subtotal footers as `groupIncludeFooter = true`.
- A grand total footer is shown as the `groupIncludeTotalFooter = true`.
- The medal totals are [aggregated](/aggregation/) via the `aggFunc: 'sum'` column property.

## Customising Footer Values

By default, the footer will display the word 'Total' followed by the group key. However, this can be changed using the
`footerValueGetter` supplied to the [Group Cell Renderer](/group-cell-renderer/) params as shown below: 
 
```
const gridOptions = {
    autoGroupColumnDef: { 
        cellRendererParams: {
            footerValueGetter: params =>  {
                const isRootLevel = params.node.level === -1;
                if (isRootLevel) {
                    return 'Grand Total';
                }
                return `Sub Total (${params.value})`;
            },
        }
    },
}
```

Note in the snippet above that the `footerValueGetter` contains special handling to display Subtotals and Grand Totals
differently. This is demonstrated in the example below.

## Customising Footer Cells

In most cases [Customising Footer Values](../grouping-footers/#customising-footer-values) is sufficient, however it is
also possible to customise the footer cell using the `innerCellRenderer` supplied to the 
[Group Cell Renderer](/group-cell-renderer/) params as shown below:

In the example below the `innerRenderer` contains special handling to display Grand Total, Subtotal and
non-footer cells differently.

<GridExampleRunner title='Customising Footer Cells' name='customising-footer-cells' type='mixed' options='{ "enterprise": true, "exampleHeight": 503, "modules": ["clientside", "rowgrouping"] }'></GridExampleRunner>

<note>
It is also possible to customise footer cells using: `cellRendererParams.innerRendererSelector`. For more details see the [Group Cell Renderer](/group-cell-renderer/) section.

## Group Footer Limitations

Group footers are a UI concept only in the grid. It is the grids way of showing aggregated data (which belongs to the group) appearing after the group's children. Because the footer is a UI concept only, the following should be noted:

- It is not possible to select footer nodes. Footer rows appear selected when the group is selected.
- When exporting custom footers to Excel/CSV, the [processRowGroupCallback](../excel-export-customising-content/) function of the export must be used to export the custom values.
- When copying custom footers to the Clipboard, the [processCellForClipboard](../clipboard/#processing-individual-cells) function of the clipboard must be used to export the custom values.
