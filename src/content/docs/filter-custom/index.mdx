title: "Custom Filter"
---

There are several ways to refine the way your column filters look and feel in ag-grid. They all based around components, which mean you can use your preferred framework to:

1. Create your own [custom filter](/component-filter/)
1. Create your own [custom floating filter](/component-floating-filter/)
1. Create your own [custom date component](/component-date/) and customise your own date picker (applies to the provided date filter and the date floating filter).
