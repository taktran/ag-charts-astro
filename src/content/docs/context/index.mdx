This sections covers how shared contextual information can be passed around the grid.

## Overview

The context object is passed to most of the callbacks used in the grid. The purpose of the context object is to allow the client application to pass details to custom callbacks such as the [Cell Renderers](/cell-rendering/) and [Cell Editors](/cell-editing/).

Note that the grid does not place anything into the context and it is not used internally by the grid.

## Context Object Example

The example below demonstrates how the context object can be used. Note the following:

- Selecting the reporting currency from the dropdown places it in the context object.

- When the reporting currency is changed the cell renderer uses the currency supplied in the context object to calculate the value using: `params.context.reportingCurrency`.

- The price column header is updated to show the selected currency using a header value getter using `ctx.reportingCurrency`.
